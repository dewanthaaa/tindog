This is a simple web project from the 100 days of Full-Stack Web Development class with Angela Yu on Udemy.

I made a little bit customization to the project.

Thanks to Bootstrap for providing such simple components and section examples.

Moreover, thank you Angela Yu. Thank you for everything that you taught me in this class. May you blessed with love and grace every day.
